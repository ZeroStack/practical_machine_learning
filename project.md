Practical Machine Learning Course: Project
========================================================

### Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

This document will attempt to demonstrate the use of data from accelerometers to predict the manner in which the exercise was conducted.

### Data

The training data for this project are available here:

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

### Load Relevant Libraries


You can also embed plots, for example:


```r
plots(cars)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): could not find function "plots"
```
